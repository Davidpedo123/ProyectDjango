# ProyectDjango
This is my project in the Django framework. Itâ€™s a basic project where fundamental concepts of Django are applied, such as login, GeneratePassword, PimeNumberCalculator, PortfolioWeb,  database management, Python functions, server management, and connection of different templates. It also includes views, URLs, and static files.
